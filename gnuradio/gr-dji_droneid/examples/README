The `autocorrelator.grc` graph is just a demonstration of how to detect DroneID frames without any OOT modules.
It does still require the use of the GNU Radio module as there are functions in the OOT that are needed.  Just no
normal OOT blocks required.

This ended up being a lot faster than doing the coding by hand, so huzzah to the GNU Radio devs!
